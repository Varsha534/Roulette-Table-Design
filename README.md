# Roulette-Table-Design
Developing a roulette table applet in Java using Abstract Window Toolkit elements for user interaction and probability concepts for realistic outcomes. Combining Java and its vast functionalities, the applet will offer a simple yet engaging virtual roulette experience, showcasing the integration of programming and probability in game design.

Introduction
Roulette is a classic casino game that has captivated players for centuries with its simplicity and excitement. The objective of the game is to predict the outcome of a spinning wheel, which contains numbered pockets ranging from 0 to 36 (and an additional double zero pocket in the American variant). Players place bets on various outcomes such as specific numbers, colours, odd or even numbers, or ranges of numbers. "The Great American Roulette" game aims to replicate the experience of playing Roulette in a casino environment. It offers a user-friendly interface where players can place bets, spin the wheel, and see the outcome of their bets. 

Sections of the Project
1. User Interface: The user interface provides the main interaction point for players. It includes components such as checkboxes for selecting bet options, text fields for entering bet amounts, buttons for spinning the wheel and cashing out, and panels for displaying the game rules and results.
2. Game Logic: The game logic handles the core functionalities of the game, including generating random numbers for the wheel spin, calculating payouts based on the player's bets, and determining win or loss outcomes. It utilizes the classes ProbabilityCalculations and RouletteWheel to implement these functionalities.
3. Graphics: Graphics play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal of the game. Theproject includes images of the roulette wheel and the ball, which are displayed dynamically to simulate the spinning motion of the wheel and the landing of the ball.
4. Functionality: The game offers various betting options, including:
• Straight bets: single number; payout – x35
• Street bets: three consecutive numbers according to the table; payout – x1
• Red / Black bets: numbers coloured Red / Black on the table; payout – x1
• Odd / Even bets: odd / even numbers; payout – x1
• Range bets: Low: 1-18, High: 19-36; payout – x1
Players can place bets by selecting checkboxes and entering bet amounts, spin the wheel to see the outcome, and cash out their remaining credits.
NOTE: The payouts mentioned above are standard payouts according to regular Roulette conventions. To increase / decrease the stakes for a play, payout values can be changed in the source code.

Algorithm
1. Initialize variables for credits, bet amount, win/loss status, and lucky number.
2. Display the main interface:
- Title of the game
- Image of the roulette wheel
- Betting options checkboxes
- Text fields for entering bet amount and single number
- Buttons for spinning, cashing out, and deselecting bets
- Results display panel
3. When the spin button is clicked:
- Generate a random number (simulating the roulette wheel spin).
- Check the selected betting options against the random number.
- Calculate winnings based on the betting options and payout multipliers.
- Update the credits display with the new balance.
- Display the results (win/loss status and lucky number).
4. When the cashout button is clicked:
- Display the remaining credits.
- Close the application.
5. When the deselect button is clicked:
- Deselect all betting options.
- Clear the results display.
6. Implement helper methods:
- Calculate winnings based on selected betting options.
- Check if a number is red or black.
- Update the results display text area.
7. Implement animation for the roulette wheel and ball spinning

Basic Components of the Program
1. Main Interface: This includes the graphical user interface (GUI) elements such as labels, text fields, checkboxes, and buttons.
2. Game Logic: This includes the core logic for generating random numbers, calculating winnings, and updating the credits balance based on the selected betting options.
3. Results Display: A panel or text area to display the results of each spin, including the win/loss status and the lucky number.
4. Animation: Implement animation for the roulette wheel and ball spinning to create a visually appealing user experience.
5. Event Handling: Handle user interactions with the GUI components, such as button clicks and checkbox selections, to trigger the corresponding actions.
6. Helper Methods: Implement helper methods for tasks such as calculating winnings, checking if a number is red or black, and updating the results display text area.
7. External Resources: Load external resources such as images of the roulette wheel, ball, and table to enhance the visual presentation of the game.

Future Improvements
1. Enhanced Graphics:
Implement more realistic animations for the spinning wheel and landing ball.
2. Additional Betting Options:
Introduce more advanced betting options such as corner bets, split bets, and neighbour bets.
3. Multiplayer Mode:
Add support for multiplayer gameplay, allowing players to compete against each other
online.
4. Sound Effects:
Incorporate sound effects to create a more immersive gaming experience.
5. Bug Fixes and Optimization:
Address any existing bugs and optimize the codebase for better performance and stability.

Conclusion
Looking back, the development of the American roulette wheel in Java using AWT and other GUI packages had been a challenging endeavour. Through careful planning and coding, a dynamic and interactive version of the classic casino game has been crafted. Leveraging Java's AWT and GUI libraries, a visually pleasing and functional application that captures the essence of American roulette has been achieved. This project successfully demonstrates the creative potential of Java programming and highlights the possibilities in software development.
